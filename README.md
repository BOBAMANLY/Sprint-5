# Overview

I wanted to write software that would be useful to myself to analyze my bank transactions and learn where I can save more money. It allowed me to learn more about how to filter data and analyze it in a way to display teh results to the user.

I am analyzing my own bank statements. You can add any csv file into the program that is downloaded by a bank.

How many times did I make purchases at Walmart or Costco?
